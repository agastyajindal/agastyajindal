Building tools and software that actually get used. Currently deep into audio development, student productivity apps, and anything that involves real technical challenges.

## What's Happening Right Now

I'm working on a couple of things that matter:

**Aethis** is a free guitar amp simulator that lets you dial in tons of different amp tones without needing thousands of dollars of hardware. Three different amp models, harmonizer, vocoder, full effects chain. Works as a VST3 plugin so it fits into your existing workflow. Built with serious attention to how the signal chain actually works.

**Plansnip** is a study planning tool designed for people who actually get stuff done. You break down what you're learning into smaller pieces, organize your time intelligently, and watch yourself make progress. It's built because every productivity app I tried felt either too simple or too complicated. This one hits the balance.

Both projects came from the same place: noticing something broken and deciding to fix it properly instead of settling for what exists.

## The Stack

Python for automation and scripting. C++ when performance matters or I'm doing something real-time. JavaScript and web tech for building interfaces that people interact with every day.

I care about making things that don't just work but feel right to use. That means thinking about performance, architecture, and the small details that separate good software from software people actually stick with.

## Interests

Audio software and signal processing in general. Building tools for students that actually help. Exploring how to make complex things simple. Performance optimization and real-time systems. Creating workflows that make sense.

## Quick Facts

Based in New Delhi. Still in high school but treating this like a full-time thing because building cool stuff is more interesting than a lot of what happens in classrooms. Learning constantly, shipping regularly, and trying to stay weird.

## Let's Build Something

If you're interested in any of these projects, want to collaborate, or just want to talk about building stuff, reach out. I'm always looking to work with people who actually care about quality.
