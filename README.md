Hey, I'm Agastya

I like building things that feel useful, fast, and a bit ahead of the curve. Most of my projects sit at the intersection of student-focused tools, audio processing, and experimental software design. If it’s creative, technical, or slightly chaotic in a fun way, I’m probably interested.

What I Work With

Python for scripting and automation.
C++ for performance-heavy and audio/DSP work.
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for building interfaces and interactive tools.

What I Build

I tend to work on:

audio software and DSP experiments, including projects like Aethis

apps and utilities built to make students lives easier

creative tools that mix design, engineering, and experimentation

software that pushes into new or unusual ideas just to see what’s possible

Goals

Keep shipping real projects. Keep exploring audio tech. Keep leveling up the craft while building things people actually want to use.
